Description:
	1. Change to 3D collidsion.
	2. Change ErgunWenYuDrag to alphas.air, since alpha.water may be 0 and causing error.

Date: 190614
Description:
	1. Change to 2D collidsion.
	2. 500 particles.
	3. Revised twoPhaseSystem.C. Found that if particle diameter greater than cell, will cause minus alpha.

Date: 190610
Description:
	1. Fixed problems
	2. Revised twoPhaseSystem.C to bound theta() and alphasFluid
	3. Calculation fails due to unrealistic alphas (too great or minus value)
	4. Waiting to be further checked

Date: 190604
Description:
	1. Fixed boundary conditions
	2. Change frontAndBack into empty (allowing 2D collidsion)

Date: 190529
Description:
	1. Add many particles, but particles not moving
	2. Add AllRun and AllClean for simplicity


Date: 190527
Description: 
	1. Revised for reactingFoam, changed phaseProperties (default continuous, types)


Date: 190522
Description: 
	1. Modified kinematicCloudProperties and kinematicCloudPositions
	2. Adding mean density "rhom" as arguments for muc calculation
	3. Revised blockMeshDict, change "patches" to "boundary", and add symmetry frontAndBack (which enables 3-D colliding evolving in "kinematicCloud.evolve()"  )
	4. Change solver name to "axiReactingEbullatingFoam"
